        Below are few among the ground breaking remarks of this great
        literalist:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Achebe was born in Ogidi, Anambra State, on November 16, 1930. At
            the age of 12 he moved several kilometres away from his family to
            Nekede to attend the Central School there before attending
            Government College Umuahia for his secondary school education.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was one of the first students to attend the University College,
            now University of Ibadan in 1948. Having first opted to study
            medicine he switched to English, history and theology after his
            first year
          </li>
          <li>
            After winning his degree Achebe taught at Ibadan before joining the
            Nigeria Broadcasting Service in 1954
          </li>
          <li>
            His 1958 novel: Things Fall Apart, set amid 1890s Nigeria and the
            influx of Christian missionaries, is renowned the world over, has
            been translated into 50 languages and has sold more than 10 million
            copies
          </li>
          <li>
            The novel takes its title from WB Yeats's 1919 poem "The Second
            Coming": "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is
            loosed upon the world…”
          </li>
          <li>
            During the country's Civil War (1967 -1970), Achebe joined the
            Biafran Government as an Ambassador. He wrote about his experiences
            in his last book, There Was A Country.
          </li>
          <li>
            Achebe's other novels include Arrow of God (1964); A Man of the
            People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). He has also
            published four children's books (including Chike and the River and
            How the Leopard Got His Claws), short stories and poetry in English
            and Igbo
          </li>
          <li>
            Nelson Mandela called him "the writer in whose company the prison
            walls came down", and credited him as the author who "brought Africa
            to the rest of the world"
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="centered-text">
          "One of the truest tests of integrity is its blunt refusal to be
          compromised."
